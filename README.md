1.Set a variable named n which would be use to store the number entered by the user.
2.Let the user enters the number(cin).
3.Use the while loop to make the decision
  if n is not equal to 1, it would go into the loop.
  In the loop, if n is an odd number, it would be multipy by 3 and add 1 for it.(n=3n+1)
  if n is even, it will be divided by 2.(n=n/2)
  Each step would be printed out.
